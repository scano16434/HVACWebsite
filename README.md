Lines 211 and 300 of index.php must be configured to match the appropriate url of the preference server before implementing. This url is removed from this GitHub repository, to protect the public ip address used to access this website. The url can be found on the index.php, hosted on the SRC Linux Machine, located in opt/lampp/htdocs.


**Running the code** <br>
